## About Fork

Rokku is a fork of [Yokai](https://github.com/null2264/yokai), which is itself a fork of [TachiyomiJ2K](https://github.com/Jays2Kings/tachiyomiJ2K) and [Mihon](https://github.com/mihonapp/mihon) (formerly Tachiyomi).

This fork was created for personal use, after Yokai fell behind on the current Keiyoushi extension ecosystem, dependencies, and various other fixes.

Updates are sporadic, sometimes fast, sometimes slow.

The name is a play on the developer's surname (Rocha, "rock" in Portuguese): 岩 (*iwa*), the kanji used as the project's symbol, is the traditional Japanese word for rock — used for natural rock formations, mountains, rock climbing, and geology. "Rokku" (ロック) is the same word in its more modern/loanword sense, closer to pop culture and "rock" as in rock 'n' roll.
